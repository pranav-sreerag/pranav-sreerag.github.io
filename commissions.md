# Indian String Puppet Collection for Common Threads Boutique (2017)

Inspired by puppets from Rajasthan, this collection of string puppets was created from wire and paper mache.

With just six strings, the puppets were surprisingly expressive!

# Mohini by Seema Hari Kumar (2019)

Mohini was a performance combining classical dance with Pavakathakali puppetry.  We created three types of puppets for the performance.

The puppets can be manipulated with a single hand.

To create these puppets, we began by visiting a traditional Pavakathakali workshop and studying their designs.

We realized wood was too heavy for non experienced performers, so we used paper mache instead to create the body parts.

# The Weight of Joy by Eric Languet (2018)

The Weight of Joy was a dance project tackling the notion of handicap and social innovation, created by French choreographer Eric Languet.  It featured a character with a horse head, which he commissioned us to create.

For the base of the horse mask, we used corrugated cardboard and pieces of a thick plastic sheet.

We covered this with cloth and some leather to create the finished mask!

<div class="flex-container">

To create these masks, we used several coats of  paper mache on top of a cardboard base.
