I first named him Chinnz, but he came to be known as the Woven Man.

Many people recognize me in this work. But when it was finished, I couldn’t believe I was the one who created it. I can’t tell you who or what the work represents, but I can say it is all about the time I was going through then, in 2015, the fourth year of college.


I was taking a new subject, called Textile Art.  The teacher was a guest faculty who had long white hair, a big bindi, and a stiff saree. As usual I was sitting on the last bench, doing my own thing. In those days it was a big surprise if I said anything in class, and most people were expecting me to drop out of the program.

Our final project was to be an installation, but we needed to get approval for the materials we wanted to use.  And we couldn’t use a material somebody else was using! Most of my classmates quickly got approval.  A few bought metal wire, or metal sheets.  Some were using waste yarn from looms. Some were making braided fabric strips.

Soon I was the only one left, but it felt like all materials were already taken.  One week passed, then two.  Soon a third week had gone by, but I still hadn’t managed to get any material approved by the teacher.

A few of my classmates had almost finished their installations.  The teacher said I wasn’t allowed in class until my material was approved, but I didn’t want to roam the campus during class time. I was sure someone would notice and report me.  So, I went to the washroom. I sat on the toilet and bolted the lavatory door, when Housekeeper Annaa came to the washroom and started cleaning.  He was cleaning an old dustbin kept in a corner and he placed one black plastic garbage bag in it.  The remaining garbage bags he kept behind the mirror. 

I watched everything through a hole from the lavatory.  And once he left, I picked up one black garbage bag, just to take a closer look.

You know the type of bag I’m talking about?  Black plastic, strong, and they come in a roll in a box.  They are attached to one another.  And at the top of each bag there is one white strip attached.
 
I don't know why I did what I did next.  But I took one metal wire I had in my pocket, and started wrapping the garbage bag around it.  Round and round and round. I found the process of wrapping both elements together very satisfying.

And then I noticed, the black rope I was building had the character of a metal wire and also the  character of the garbage bag. It had become friendlier to handle than the lone wire, but much more versatile than the bag.

I was still in the toilet. I quickly followed the outline of my hand and I wove my new material in between my fingers.  Soon I had made a replica of my hand. It seemed the material could adapt to any shape.  I went and showed it to the teacher, and it passed.

And I started work on the body.  Days went by, then weeks, then months. Twisting, coiling, knotting, weaving, piece by piece by piece. 
Welding pieces together with an iron rod.  Slowly the human form of the Woven Man emerged.
