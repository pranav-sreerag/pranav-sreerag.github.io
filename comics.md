# Our Parachutes

This place – is this really my home?  What all is here!  I almost don’t believe it!

The year is 2003.  And the place really is my Tharavadu, near Kodunthirapully village, just outside Palakkad town.

But I’ve never seen our village like this.  The Navarathri festival is happening.  The famous nine days celebration.  Right now it’s the second to last day.

It’s the time of Mahanavami, Durgashtami.  I’m ten years old.

Walking I see elephants – and not just a few.  Musical instruments are everywhere. And fireworks are bursting in the sky.

On that day books, tools, vehicles, and all other work-related instruments are kept aside for Pooja.  A sweet custom, isn’t it?  For one full day, we take a rest from all work.  Which means I can escape from Mummy. She is always torturing me: “Study, study, study!”  But what should I even be studying?  I am not understanding anything fully, anything they teach in school. Facts just won’t stick in my mind, they immediately fly away. In that period I was moving through life like a dream.

We all go together for the festival pooja – Me, Chinnu, Appu, Aji, Jishnu, and so many friends.  We are here, there, everywhere, roaming all over the gramam. From morning to night. Many spots are decorated with flowers, leaves, colors, and lights. Fully crowded, people everywhere, selling balloons, toys, food, and jewelry.  It's a huge festival market. A market full of joy.  On the road where we walk we can smell the poop of elephants.

I remember when I was an even smaller kid I came here with my Daddy.  I remember touching an elephant with him.

Now it’s the last day of the festival.  It has moved to a ground called Panaparambil.  More than 21 elephants stand with Panjavadyam, Chenda Melam, Shingari Melam.  There are ice-cream uncles at every corner, each operating an icebox on top of a cycle. There is a Kavadi – a colorful declaration of flowers and feathers, big and round like a dome.  There is a muscle man keeping so much weight on his head while dancing dancing dancing. There must be more than two thousand people, easily! Grandmother and grandfather, dad and mom, son and daughter, aunt and uncle, brother and sister, husband and wife, cat and dog, all together, awaiting the final evening festivities.

Time is long and free.  Firecrackers go up and – dum dum dum – burst into brilliant colors. Then we see one big ball go up into the evening sky. 
This is not a cracker.  Not fireworks.  Something else.  Something new.

But it makes the same – dum – sound, like a big drum, or a bomb.
The ball goes up into the sky and – dum.  
Do you know what that is? 
Colorful papers burst from the ball in the sky, and from those papers a colorful parachute appears! Slowly opening, unrolling and flying through the sky, following the wind.

More than 20 mysterious balls like this go up, one by one. Big ones, small ones, like nothing we’ve seen before, these parachutes sail away through the sky.  Each time my friends run like mad, trying to chase down the newest parachute. But nobody manages to track down a single one.  I’m also running, running behind the colors in the sky. How long can we keep running? The parachute must travel 2 or 3 kilometers before it hits the ground.  Still we run, full of hope. We run past crowded roads, dirt roads, bamboo fences,  paddy fields, ponds, and empty lands, past trees and hills.

My home is actually a proper beautiful village. But we didn't find even one parachute. I can still see them moving across the sky, far far away.  So I walk back to my house with my brothers and friends, empty handed.

Entering my road, I see Daddy’s brother holding some big plastic cover wrapped in ropes. He points it at me. It’s a really big parachute tied to a bag, heavy with some weight!
  
All my cousins arrive, and we climb to the rooftop and throw the parachute off the side and watch.  It falls to the ground like a stone.

There is a small ground with a small village god near my house.  I run here and there, holding the heavy bag, the parachute trailing behind me, and all my cousins chasing me and the parachute.  Round and round I run.

Waking up the next morning, all I want is to remove the knots from the parachute to see how it’s actually made.  Maybe I can make more like it?

The knots are fine and really tight and so even.  I really like the way somebody put a knot at the very top of it all. I start removing knots very gently, very slowly, one by one. There are 16 ropes coming from the plastic parachute to the cloth bag, which is full of sand.  After removing three or four ropes, I think I understand how it is made.

I find a couple of plastic bags in the kitchen, and I start cutting them into squares and rectangles.  Then I take some stitching thread from my aunt’s cupboard. I now see that I can't possibly make such a big parachute, because I don't have the same big plastic cover and I don't have the same ropes.  So I’ll have to make a smaller version.  I use just eight threads, and instead of the pouch of sand, I use a small rock.

After making the first parachute I make a few more, for all of my cousins and for my friends, all in different colors and sizes.

My brother and my cousins and I all go to our terrace rooftop, and we start throwing the parachutes one by one off the edge. It is working this time and we enjoy the view, watching each one fly through the sky and sail down slowly towards earth.

And before a parachute can reach the ground, one of us is already there to collect it and bring it back to the rooftop, to throw it off again!

I should say that discovering the way a parachute travels in air – the gentle tension between its weight and its sail – was really beautiful. We all still remember that week running behind our parachutes.
