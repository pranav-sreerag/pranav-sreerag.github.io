When I returned to my family’s farm during the pandemic, I reconnected with several interesting
plants that most people don't usually care about, maybe because of their shape or appearance. But for me they were popping up everywhere, like they were the only thing my eyes could see. These plants are very typical to our locality, but only grow in specific seasons.  When I’m in cities I miss them.  But when I come back to my native place, these are the first beings to welcome me home.  And my old Malayalam textbook is full of these plants – in drawings I made as a child in the book’s margins!

Nowadays in my village people don't pay much attention to these plants that I love: thottavadi, mukkathi, thumba, kalli, mulla chedi (kalli cactus), to name a few.

I really wanted to showcase these plants, and display them in the right manner.  So I thought I'd make interesting planters, to give them the presentation they deserve.  I figured I could sell them online to get some pocket money too.

I began by making planters using wire left over from previous projects. After making, making, making, I realized I can only make so many on my own, so it would be nice to collaborate with people who truly have craft hands – people who make pottery and basketry for a livelihood.  There used to be many such people in my village, but when I looked in the usual places I couldn't find them!

I came to know that many people left their traditional jobs and moved to cities.  They were not getting proper income from making pots and baskets.  Also, they were not getting enough resources: proper soil, proper bamboo fiber.  But eventually I found there were still a few families remaining. A person named Kannan, doing pottery. And another person named Kethan, doing basketry. I explained my idea of having small baskets and pots, as planters.  First they said they weren’t interested, that they weren’t making planters any more.  But eventually we became  friends and they changed their minds!

To make the planters more interesting, I started playing with the shapes and sizes, and painting some simple designs and patterns.
