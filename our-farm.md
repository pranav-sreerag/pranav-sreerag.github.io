My ancestors on both my mom's side and my dad's side were farmers in Palakkad District, Kerala.

We cultivated rice, moong dal, tur dal, ground nuts, urad dal, green peas, and koorka (a tuber), all together.  In those days my family had many cows and buffalos who helped out on the farm.

Our house is surrounded by lots of palm trees (pana maram). In those days the roof of our house was made from palm leaf and coconut.

I remember hearing how my grandfather used to work under a 'jenmi' landlord back then. I don't know what share they received from the landlord, but in those days they weren't even allowed in the common pond by the upper castes, so my grandfather would sneak in before 4am to take a bath. 




After some time my grandfather received some amount of land from the government under a new policy giving land rights to the people who work the land.

My family managed to expand the land using the profits they earned, once they had ownership of it. In those days, during the harvest season, it was like a festival.  Everyone from the village would be doing some work or other: some people harvesting paddy, some separating paddy from the straw, some transporting sacks of paddy, and others chewing betel leaves and singing songs. The last day of the harvest they would have a big party, drink toddy without us kids knowing, and generally celebrate.

Nowadays many changes have taken place. We slowly sold off the cows, we stopped cultivating urad dal, cut down many palm trees, and slowly moved into modern monoculture rice paddy farming. We still have some vegetables for our own consumption, but much less than in my grandfather's time, which I still remember fondly from childhood.

In 2011 I moved to Chennai for college and spent almost 10 years separated from the land. But then during the pandemic of 2020 my cousins and I came back, all together, and started doing some experiments in agriculture.

 There was a small piece of land with palm trees in the corner.  In that land the paddy was not doing so well, so my father and I decided to try growing some vegetables instead.

We planted some turmeric, some green peas,  five banana trees, a couple of marigold flowers, okra, tomato, pumpkin, and even brinjal. Almost every morning I would look forward to spending some time there!

The harvest was not as big as I first expected, but the experience with the soil was priceless.Â  I got to know the weaver birds who have colonies on the palm trees, a white neighbour dog who jumps on me every day, peacocks that say 'kioooo kioooooo', butterflies and dragonflies, crabs and small fish, and many many others!

The vegetables and fruits we harvested were shared among our small circle of friends. That year of coming back to the land was honestly a life changing experience.


I don't want to be a person who gives up on farming; I hope I can find a way to continue the tradition of my ancestors.
