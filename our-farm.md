My ancestors from both my mom's side and my dad's side were farmers in Palakkad District, Kerala.

I remember hearing how my grandfather used to work under a jenmi landlord.  In those days they had a few cows and buffalos, and managed lots of palm trees (pana maram).

In those days the roof of their house was made from palm leaf and coconut.

In that time they cultivated rice, moong dal, tur dal, ground nuts, urad dal, green peas, and koorka (a tuber).

I don't know what margin they received from the landlord, but in those days they weren't allowed in the common pond by the upper castes, so my grandfather would sneak in before 4am to take a bath.  




After some time my grandfather received some amount of land from the government under a new policy giving land rights to the people who work the land.

My family managed to expand the land using the profits they earned, once they had ownership of it. In those days, during the harvest season, it was like a festival. Everyone from the village would be doing some work or other. Some people separating paddy from the straw, some transporting sacks of paddy, and others chewing betal leaves and singing songs.  The last day of the harvest they would have a big party, drink toddy without us kids knowing, and generally celebrate.

Nowadays many changes have taken place.  We slowly sold off the cows, we stopped cultivating urad dal, cut down many palm trees, and slowly moved into a modern monoculture of rice paddy farming.  We still have some vegetables for our own consumption, but much less than in my grandfather's time, which I still remember from childhood.

In 2011 I moved to Chennai for college and spent almost 10 years separated from the land.  But then during the pandemic of 2020 my cousins and I came back, all together, and started doing some experiments in agriculture.

There was a small piece of land where the paddy was not doing so well, so my father and I decided to try growing some vegetables there.

We planted some turmeric, green peas, banana trees, marigold flowers, okra, tomato, pumpkin, and even brinjal.

From that plot we started getting more vegetables for the household.  That year coming back to the land was a really good experience honestly.

I don't want to be a person who gives up on farming; I hope I can find a way to continue the tradition of my ancestors.
