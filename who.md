<p>
ikkarai, this shore, is a refuge to so many of us who have failed to fit into a mainstream career trajectory, or have drifted away from one, or have reshaped it into something else entirely.

This has made us eager to share our experiences with others who might be feeling the same â€” in particular, children, young adults and students, who are often made to feel like  squares pegs forced into round holes. Our hope is that is that collectively we can create  new forms of expression through art, which can fill the gaps that everyday ordinary words leave behind.

ikkarai consists of people from various backgrounds, including theatre, dance, puppetry, textile design, music, mathematics, and illustration.
