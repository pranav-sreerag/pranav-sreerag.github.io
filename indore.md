title: What's <i>ikkarai</i>?
permalink: /meaning/
---


The word 'ikkarai' means ‘this shore’ in Tamil.  Most Tamil speakers know it from the saying ‘ikkarai-kku akkarai pachai’ which means ‘to this shore the other shore looks green’. This familiar saying is often deployed to remind us that we should work with what we have rather than hankering after seemingly greener pastures.


But the saying also challenges a simplistic narrative of progress — that the problems of the present can easily be erased, that we will inevitably move to a glorious future.  Rather, some of the  most uncomfortable and brutal aspects of our human history are  with us today and will be with us in the future.  All of it is here with us on this shore.


‘ikkarai’ is what we all have in common, what belongs to all of us, what we are rooted to, from which we face the sea of the future. 
 We may strive for a better world, or contend with limited resources, but we do it together from this shore.


<!--
‘This shore’ can be the balcony overlooking the street.  It can be the tip of your nose, or the outer rim of the galaxy. It can be where we are out of place, where we are in our place. It is simply where we are. -->
