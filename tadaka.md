In 2017 and 2018 I worked on masks and art for Madhushree Basu’s play ‘Maradhyana’, originally created for Gender Bender 2017.

Maradhyana is a dance-drama based on a sub-story within the Ramayana,
 centered around the character of the ‘Demoness’ Thadaka, who was killed
 by Rama.

In particular the piece is inspired by the Malayalam poet Vayalar Ramavarma’s poem 
‘Thadaka’, which depicts the same woman as a valiant Dravidian princess. The
 princess feels amorous at Rama and attempts to befriend him, but 
without forgetting the welfare of her own kingdom and their land rights.
 While Rama tends to reciprocate positively toward her romantic as well 
as political proposals, his guardian sage Vishwamitra intervenes and 
intimidates Rama into killing Thadaka.
